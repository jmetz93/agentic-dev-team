# Agentic Dev Team Plugin

The **agentic-dev-team** plugin implements a fully automated software development team using persona-driven AI agents orchestrated through a three-phase workflow: **Research → Plan → Implement**. Each agent has defined responsibilities, collaboration protocols, and behavioral guidelines. Skills are reusable knowledge modules any agent can invoke.

---

# Team Agents

Team agents are persona-driven roles that implement, design, coordinate, and communicate. The Orchestrator routes every request to one or more team agents based on task classification.

## Orchestrator

**File:** `agents/orchestrator.md` | **Model:** Sonnet

The central dispatcher. Classifies every incoming request, selects and loads only the agents needed for the current phase, manages the three-phase workflow (Research → Plan → Implement), enforces the 40% context ceiling, and runs the inline review loop during implementation. Spans all phases; all other agents are loaded on demand.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Task routing and model assignment for all review agents
- Parallel plan review (four critic personas) before human gate
- Inline review loop: spec compliance → quality review → auto-fix (up to 5 iterations)
- Phase transition: writes structured progress files to `memory/` between phases

---

## Software Engineer

**File:** `agents/software-engineer.md` | **Model:** Sonnet (Opus for architectural changes)

Implements code following RED-GREEN-REFACTOR. Applies review corrections, writes vertical slices, and produces verification evidence (fresh test output) before claiming completion.

**Skills used:** Test-Driven Development, Systematic Debugging, Hexagonal Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, Legacy Code, Branch Workflow

---

## QA / SQA Engineer

**File:** `agents/qa-engineer.md` | **Model:** Sonnet

Owns acceptance test-driven development. Writes BDD scenarios before implementation begins, generates test infrastructure, validates behavior against acceptance criteria, and performs peer validation of other agents' output.

**Skills used:** Test-Driven Development, Feature File Validation, Mutation Testing, Test Design Reviewer, Browser Testing, Quality Gate Pipeline

---

## Architect

**File:** `agents/architect.md` | **Model:** Opus

Defines system structure, makes technology decisions, enforces architectural boundaries, and writes ADRs for significant decisions. Owns the research phase for non-trivial features and reviews plans for structural risk.

**Skills used:** Hexagonal Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, Domain Analysis, API Design, Threat Modeling, Design Doc, Design It Twice, Design Interrogation

---

## Product Manager

**File:** `agents/product-manager.md` | **Model:** Sonnet

Clarifies requirements, manages scope, produces user stories, and ensures the plan solves the right problem. Runs the Specs skill to produce BDD-aligned acceptance criteria before planning begins.

**Skills used:** Specs, Human Oversight Protocol, Competitive Analysis, Design Interrogation

---

## Security Engineer

**File:** `agents/security-engineer.md` | **Model:** Sonnet

Performs threat modeling, assesses attack surface, and provides secure design guidance. Runs STRIDE analysis for new APIs, authentication changes, and data flows crossing trust boundaries. Collaborates with Platform Engineer on infrastructure security.

**Skills used:** Threat Modeling, Quality Gate Pipeline, Governance & Compliance

---

## Platform Engineer

**File:** `agents/platform-engineer.md` | **Model:** Sonnet

Owns pipelines, deployment strategy, observability, and reliability planning. Provides self-service infrastructure capabilities to development teams. Advocates for safe, observable deployments and SLO-driven reliability.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Pipeline design and maintenance (build, test, deploy)
- Deployment strategies: blue-green, canary, rolling, feature flags
- Observability: metrics, logs, traces
- Reliability planning: SLOs, SLIs, error budgets
- Infrastructure-as-code and environment management

**Skills used:** Quality Gate Pipeline, Governance & Compliance, Docker Image Create, Docker Image Audit, Performance Benchmark, CI Debugging

---

## Technical Writer

**File:** `agents/tech-writer.md` | **Model:** Sonnet

Maintains documentation accuracy, enforces ubiquitous language, and ensures all affected docs are updated after implementation. Runs after every implementation phase to verify docs reflect the current state of the system.

**Skills used:** Agent & Skill Authoring, Governance & Compliance

---

## UI/UX Designer

**File:** `agents/ui-ux-designer.md` | **Model:** Sonnet

Defines interface patterns, UX flows, and accessibility requirements. Reviews UI changes for WCAG compliance and cognitive load. Participates in plan review as the UX Critic persona.

---

## ADR Author

**File:** `agents/adr.md` | **Model:** Sonnet

Creates and manages Architecture Decision Records. Applies a decision framework to determine when an ADR is needed, writes the record with context, decision, and consequences, and flags when existing ADRs need updating.

---

## Codebase Recon

**File:** `agents/codebase-recon.md` | **Model:** Sonnet

Read-only reconnaissance agent. Surveys a codebase's entry points, dependency graph, security surface, and git history. Produces a structured RECON artifact in `memory/` that other agents consume during the Research phase.

---

# Review Agents

Review agents run as sub-agents during Phase 3 inline checkpoints and full `/code-review` runs. They are spawned by the Orchestrator — never invoked directly. Model assignment follows the Orchestrator's routing table.

| `spec-compliance-review` | Sonnet | Spec-to-code matching — first gate before quality review |
| `test-review` | Sonnet | Coverage gaps, assertion quality, test hygiene |
| `security-review` | Opus | Injection, auth/authz, data exposure, crypto |
| `domain-review` | Opus | Abstraction leaks, boundary violations, entity/DTO confusion |
| `arch-review` | Opus | ADR compliance, layer violations, dependency direction |
| `structure-review` | Sonnet | SRP violations, DRY, coupling, file organization |
| `concurrency-review` | Sonnet | Race conditions, async pitfalls, shared state safety |
| `js-fp-review` | Sonnet | Array/parameter mutations, impure patterns (JS/TS only) |

| `refactoring-review` | Sonnet | Post-GREEN refactoring opportunities (TDD REFACTOR phase) |
| `progress-guardian` | Sonnet | Plan adherence, commit discipline, scope creep detection |
| `data-flow-tracer` | Sonnet | Data flow tracing through architecture layers (analysis-only) |
| `complexity-review` | Haiku | Cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, function size |
| `naming-review` | Haiku | Intent-revealing names, magic values, boolean prefixes |
| `performance-review` | Haiku | Resource leaks, N+1 queries, unbounded growth, timeouts |
