# Agent & Skill Registry (Full)

This file contains the complete registry tables. CLAUDE.md references this file for on-demand loading — the orchestrator reads it when routing decisions require the full catalog.

## Review Agents

Spawned by the orchestrator during Phase 3 inline checkpoints and full `/code-review` runs. Model selection follows the **Orchestrator Model Routing Table** in `agents/orchestrator.md`.

## Subagent Prompt Templates

Concrete prompt templates in `prompts/` that the orchestrator and `/code-review` use when dispatching subagents, making behavior reproducible.

| Template | File | Used By |
|----------|------|---------|
| Implementer | `prompts/implementer.md` | Orchestrator (Phase 3 implementation dispatch) |
| Spec Reviewer | `prompts/spec-reviewer.md` | Orchestrator (three-stage review gate 1) |

| Plan Reviewer | `prompts/plan-reviewer.md` | Orchestrator (Phase 2 automated pre-check) |

| Plan Review — Strategic | `prompts/plan-review-strategic.md` | Orchestrator (Phase 2 plan review persona) |

## Knowledge Files

Knowledge files in `knowledge/` provide progressive disclosure — agents read them on demand during analysis rather than carrying all detection patterns inline.

| File | ~Tokens | Used By |
|------|---------|---------|
| Agent Registry | `knowledge/agent-registry.md` | 1,200 | Orchestrator (routing decisions) |
| Review Template | `knowledge/review-template.md` | 400 | `/code-review` (report assembly) |
| Review Rubric | `knowledge/review-rubric.md` | 300 | `/code-review` (health scoring) |
| OWASP Detection | `knowledge/owasp-detection.md` | 600 | security-review |
| Domain Modeling | `knowledge/domain-modeling.md` | 500 | domain-review |
| Architecture Assessment | `knowledge/architecture-assessment.md` | 450 | arch-review |
| Exploratory Testing Field Guide | `knowledge/exploratory-testing-field-guide.md` | ~900 | QA Engineer, `skills/exploratory-testing/SKILL.md` |

## Agent Templates

Language-specific review agents in `templates/agents/`. Scaffolded into projects by `/setup` when the matching stack is detected. Not bundled as always-on.

| front-end-testing | `templates/agents/front-end-testing.md` | Any frontend framework |
| twelve-factor-audit | `templates/agents/twelve-factor-audit.md` | Service/API project |
