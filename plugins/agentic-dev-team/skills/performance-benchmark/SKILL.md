# Performance Benchmark Skill

## Overview

This skill measures **runtime performance** — what the user actually experiences — as opposed to the `performance-review` agent which analyzes code patterns statically. It uses Playwright to load pages in a real browser, collect timing metrics via the Performance API, measure resource sizes, and compare results against baselines and budgets.

## When to Use

- Before and after performance-sensitive changes to detect regressions
- As part of a pre-PR quality gate for frontend changes
- To establish baselines for new pages or features
- To track performance trends over time across releases
- When the plan flags a step as performance-critical

## Prerequisites

Playwright with Chromium:
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

A running dev server (or accessible URL) for the pages being benchmarked.

## Metrics Collected

### Core Web Vitals

| Metric | API | Budget Default | What It Measures |
|--------|-----|---------------|-----------------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | `PerformanceObserver('largest-contentful-paint')` | ≤ 2500ms | When the main content is visible |
| **FID** (First Input Delay) | `PerformanceObserver('first-input')` | ≤ 100ms | Responsiveness to first interaction |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | `PerformanceObserver('layout-shift')` | ≤ 0.1 | Visual stability during load |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | `PerformanceObserver('event')` | ≤ 200ms | Responsiveness throughout lifecycle |

### Navigation Timing

| Metric | API | What It Measures |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| **TTFB** (Time to First Byte) | `performance.timing.responseStart - navigationStart` | Server response time |
| **FCP** (First Contentful Paint) | `PerformanceObserver('paint')` | When first content appears |
| **DOM Interactive** | `performance.timing.domInteractive` | When DOM is parseable |
| **Load Complete** | `performance.timing.loadEventEnd` | When page is fully loaded |

### Resource Metrics

| Metric | How Collected | Budget Default |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Total transfer size** | `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')` sum | ≤ 500KB |
| **JS bundle size** | Filter resources by `.js` extension | ≤ 200KB |
| **CSS bundle size** | Filter resources by `.css` extension | ≤ 50KB |
| **Image payload** | Filter resources by image MIME types | ≤ 300KB |
| **Request count** | Resource entry count | ≤ 50 |
| **Largest resource** | Max single transfer size | ≤ 150KB |

## Collection Script Template

The benchmark runs a single Node.js script via Playwright that:

1. Launches headless Chromium with consistent viewport (1280×720) and CPU throttling (4x slowdown for mobile simulation, or 1x for desktop)
2. Navigates to the target URL with `waitUntil: 'networkidle'`
3. Injects a Performance Observer to capture Web Vitals
4. Waits for metrics to stabilize (2s after load)
5. Collects all `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')` entries
6. Returns structured JSON

See `references/benchmark-script.md` for the full script template.

### Measurement Reliability

To reduce variance:
- Run each page **3 times** and take the **median** for each metric
- Use `--disable-gpu` and `--disable-extensions` flags
- Clear browser cache between runs (`context.clearCookies()`, fresh context per run)
- Use consistent network conditions (no throttling by default; `--3g` flag for mobile simulation)

## Modes

### Baseline Mode (`--baseline`)

Captures current metrics and saves them as the baseline for future comparisons:

```
benchmarks/<slug>/baseline.json
```

Baseline files are committed to the repo so the team shares a common reference point.

### Compare Mode (default)

Runs the benchmark and compares against the saved baseline:

- **Regression**: Metric worsened by > 10% → `fail`
- **Degradation**: Metric worsened by 5-10% → `warn`
- **Improvement**: Metric improved by > 10% → noted in report
- **Stable**: Within ±5% → `pass`

### Budget Mode (`--budget`)

Checks against absolute performance budgets defined in a `performance-budget.json` file at the project root:

```json
{
  "budgets": [
    {
      "path": "/",
      "metrics": {
        "LCP": 2500,
        "CLS": 0.1,
        "totalTransferSize": 500000,
        "jsSize": 200000
      }
    },
    {
      "path": "/dashboard",
      "metrics": {
        "LCP": 3000,
        "totalTransferSize": 800000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If no budget file exists, use the defaults from the tables above.

### Trend Mode (`--trend`)

Reads historical benchmark results from `benchmarks/<slug>/history.jsonl` and produces a trend summary showing how metrics have changed over the last N runs.

## Regressions

- **LCP**: +15.6% (1600ms → 1850ms) — investigate main.js growth

## Verdict: WARN (1 regression detected)
```

## Integration Points

- **QA Engineer**: Invokes this skill for performance and load testing
- **Platform Engineer**: Uses baselines for SLI/SLO definition
- **`/build` command**: Can be triggered after performance-critical steps (when step metadata includes `performance-sensitive: true`)
- **`/code-review`**: The `performance-review` agent flags code patterns; this skill validates the runtime impact
- **Browser Testing skill**: Shares Playwright infrastructure and patterns
